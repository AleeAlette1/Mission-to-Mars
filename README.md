# Mission-to-Mars
In this project I used Python Script to scrape text and images from the NASA Science Mars Exploration website using Chrome Developer tooks. I used Beautiful Soup to automate a web broser and perform the scrape. I used MongoMB to store the data and then used Flask to create a web application with a rendered HTML template designed using Bootstrap to display the summarized data that was gathered. I used Bootstrap to make sure website was mobile-responsive.
Scarped data to gather information about the planet Mars: 
  - Latest News.
  - Featured Image.
  - Facts about the planet.
  - Images of the hemispheres.
